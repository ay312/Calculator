# Calculator

This is V1 of the calculator I have created.

I know that it is less readable due to the arrow functions used, however I am new to javascript having come from a java
background so I am practicing arrow functions in order to familiarise with it.

In practice I do not plan to use arrow functions unless it is used in industry due to the code being less readable and 
not maintainable.

Hopefully I can update it later with actual buttons that I can integrate with the html tags and the css stylesheets and js
when I learn more.

Thanks for your interest in V1 of my calculator. Any tips please feel free to contact me at ayoubdouiri65@gmail.com
